# Project for algorithmic trading of (dynamic) delta hedging


## dev:

* `poetry install`
* `pre-commit install`


## TO DO:

* Search which ETF has the least movement between closing price at 4:30pm and opening price at 9:30am (i.e., little movement outside regular trading hours).
* Look at how often the above happens depending on the option's DTE.
